# arduino-RC-Controller
### INFO

This project is created to allow user to interpret PPM/PWM data coming from a RC Receiver to do stuff like :


- controlling RC Model lighting - possibly with various modes
- mounting a DSLR/MILC cameras and control shutter from RC remote using a dedicated button/channel
- possibly talking to APM
- more to come


### Hardware

For now the hardware needed to implement this project is a simple Atmega8A/16 with Arduino code without the bootloader
The project also incorporates the use of neopixel strips/rings/single LEDs and appropriate AdaFruit NeoPixel library
